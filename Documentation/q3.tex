    How many students are enrolled per subject?
}

Retrieve the number of students enrolled in each subject by joining the \texttt{course} and \texttt{enrollment} tables based on the course ID. \texttt{GROUP} the results by course name and \texttt{COUNT} the distinct student IDs to determine how many students are enrolled in each subject. The results are sorted in descending order using \texttt{DESC} to show the subjects with the highest enrollment first.
