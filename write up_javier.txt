This exercise provided a valuable learning experience for our group by allowing us to use the essential approach to structuring data, the dimensional model. In this lab exercise, we designed a star schema to store information. It is divided into dimensions: courses, students, enrollments, and admission, where the student enrollment fact table is the center. The normalized schema diagram emphasized eliminating data redundancy and maintaining data integrity. It was a complex web of interconnected tables, each serving a specific purpose. We appreciated how this approach prevented data anomalies and ensured that updates and modifications to the database would not result in inconsistencies. 

However, as we continued to work on the lab exercise, our group began to realize the limitations of the normalized schema, especially when it came to analyzing and reporting on the data. Queries required complex JOIN operations across multiple tables, which could be cumbersome and inefficient for business intelligence purposes. This was where the dimensional model schema provided a more intuitive and efficient way to organize data for analytical purposes. It introduced the concepts of facts and dimensions. In our case, facts represented quantitative data such as the tuition fees, miscellaneous fees, and many more, and the dimensions lessened the tables compared to the previous schema.

Creating a dimensional model schema was an eye-opening experience. We saw how this approach simplified reporting and data analysis. Queries previously convoluted with JOINs now became straightforward, making extracting meaningful insights from the data more accessible. The group learned that dimensional modeling was particularly well-suited for data warehousing and business intelligence scenarios where quick access to summarized data was crucial. 

In conclusion, our experience with this lab exercise using both dimensional and normalized schema diagrams has been invaluable. While the normalized schema taught us the importance of data integrity and consistency, the dimensional model schema showcased the significance of data accessibility and analysis. Both approaches have their merits and are essential in different contexts but as data scientist professionals in the future, understanding when to use each schema approach is a valuable skill that we will carry forward in our academic and professional journey.
