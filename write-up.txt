During Lab Exercise #1, we engaged in the hands-on application of SQL queries. It was a valuable learning experience as we practiced writing SQL statements to retrieve, filter, and aggregate data from various database tables. Last year, this concept was taught to us, so it was a struggle to review and apply these topics to the task. The exercise also allowed the group to solidify their understanding of SQL fundamentals, such as SELECT statements, JOIN operations, GROUP BY clauses, and we canâ€™t forget the other keywords like DISTINCT, AS, and many more. We also gained confidence in constructing queries to extract meaningful insights from a database. Lab Exercise #1 provided a practical foundation for working with databases and was a significant step forward in the group's SQL journey.
