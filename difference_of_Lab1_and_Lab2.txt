The querying approaches in Lab Exercise #1 and Lab Exercise #2 diverge significantly, reflecting the unique characteristics of each exercise's objectives and database schemas. In Lab Exercise #1, the primary focus was on SQL querying within a normalized schema. Here, SQL queries were employed to retrieve, filter, and manipulate data from a database structured into multiple related tables. While this normalization strategy was geared towards maintaining data integrity by eliminating redundancy and anomalies, it often entailed intricate JOIN operations to access information across various tables. 

The Lab Exercise #2, on the other hand, centered on dimensional modeling. It entailed designing a star schema tailored for business intelligence and analytical reporting purposes. This schema simplified data organization by introducing a central fact table (e.g., student enrollment) surrounded by dimension tables (e.g., courses, students). This simplification led to more efficient and intuitive queries, as the need for complex JOINs was reduced. The introduction of fact and dimension tables facilitated data accessibility and analysis, making Lab Exercise #2 particularly suitable for data warehousing and reporting scenarios where quick access to summarized data is paramount. Thus, while Lab Exercise #1 underscored the significance of data integrity and complex JOIN operations within a normalized schema, Lab Exercise #2 highlighted the importance of data accessibility, analysis, and efficient querying within a dimensional model schema, emphasizing their relevance in the broader field of data warehousing and business intelligence.
